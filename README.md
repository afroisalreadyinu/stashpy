Stashpy aims to be a Python 3 replacement for Logstash. It is still in
development.

## Installing

Stashpy is [on PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/stashpy), so you can
simply install it as a dependency, or with `pip install stashpy`.

## Usage

Start with `stashpy sample-config.yml`. As can be seen from the
extension, the configuration format is YAML.
